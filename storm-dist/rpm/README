This directory and submodules define custom packaging of storm, not specifically
intended to ever be pulled back into storm proper.

The goal here is to create a parameterized custom deployment (eg, rpm) of the storm
version that *this* branch is based on.

Build:

    - Use Java 6 to build.
    - Note that no deploy phase is necessary; storm-dist/rpm
      will deploy as part of package phase.

    $ mvn clean install source:jar javadoc:jar -DskipTests
    $ cd storm-dist/binary && mvn clean install -Pdist -Dgpg.skip
    $ cd storm-dist/rpm    && mvn clean deploy -Prpm-dist -Dprovided.target.s3RepositoryPath=/path/to/s3repo
